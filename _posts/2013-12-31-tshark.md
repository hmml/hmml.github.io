# tl;dr;

Use tshark to monitor WiFi traffic around you and check MAC addresses around you:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -a duration:16 -I -i en1 -Tfields -e wlan.sa 2>/dev/null | sort -u
{% endhighlight %}

# Installing tshark

 - Download and install Wireshark package from [wireshark.org](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html).
 - Installer will create various symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`.

# Monitoring

First, let's check what kind of interfaces we can use (this is what I get): 

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -D     
1. en0 (Ethernet)
2. fw0 (FireWire)
3. bridge0 (Thunderbolt Bridge)
4. en1 (Wi-Fi)
5. p2p0
6. en4 (Thunderbolt 1)
7. lo0 (Loopback)
{% endhighlight %}

Basic usage:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -i en1
{% endhighlight %}

This will continue to produce data. Stop it with `CTRL + C`. You'll get even more data if you add `-I` (capture in monitor mode) parameter:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -I -i en1
{% endhighlight %}

In `monitor mode` WiFi icon will change from:

![Captured traffic viewed in Safari]({{ site.url }}/images/tshark/normal.jpg)

to:

![Captured traffic viewed in Safari]({{ site.url }}/images/tshark/monitor.jpg)

Tshark produces lots of data. We can use different output format to make it more readable (`-T pdml`) and and capture only 10 packets (`-c 10`):

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -I -i en1 -T pdml -c 10 > captured.xml                                                  
Capturing on 'Wi-Fi'
10 
$ cp /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/Resources/share/wireshark/pdml2html.xsl . 
$ open -a Safari captured.xml 
{% endhighlight %}

This will open Safari with human readable version of `captured.xml`.

![Captured traffic viewed in Safari]({{ site.url }}/images/tshark/safari.jpg)

But we can do much more in the command line, for example scan network for 16 seconds and print all spotted WiFi MAC addresses:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -a duration:16 -I -i en1 -Tfields -e wlan.sa 2>/dev/null | sort -u
{% endhighlight %}

You can paste them into [OUI Lookup Tool](http://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html) to do a reverse lookup of manufactures. List of available fields listed in the [documentation](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/w/wlan.html). 

Alternatively you might do it in command line as well:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tshark -a duration:16 -I -i en1 -o column.format:'"","%rhs"' 2>/dev/null | sort -u
{% endhighlight %}

If you're curious about additional parameters, here's the explanation from [explainshell.com](http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=tshark+-a+duration%3A16+-I+-i+en1+-o+column.format%3A%27%22%22%2C%22%25hs%22%27+2%3E%2Fdev%2Fnull+%7C+sort+-u).
